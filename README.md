# COLA_Project

## About
The [COLA Tracker Website](https://cola.govapps.us/) is a tool that allows users to sign up to receive notifications when Post Allowance (COLA) rates change. This app monitors COLA rates found at [aoprals.state.gov](https://aoprals.state.gov/Web920/cola.asp). Users can subscribe to one or more posts and receive email notifications when COLA rates to these posts change.

This web app was created as a VSFS project in collaboration with the US Embassy Gaborone in Botswana. For more information on the VSFS program, see [here](https://vsfs.state.gov/).

## Usage
Create an account at [cola.govapps.us](https://cola.govapps.us/). Choose which posts to be notified when COLA rates change.  Receive emails when these rates change.

This system monitors COLA rates found at [aoprals.state.gov](https://aoprals.state.gov/Web920/cola.asp) daily. When COLA rates change for a post to which you are subscribed, we will notify you via email within 24 hours.
